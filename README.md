About
=====

This repository hosts a basic [`zsh`][0] [completion][1] script for [`xpra`][2].

It's neither complete, yet, nor especially sophisticated, but I hope it may
serve as basic support for people just getting their feet wet with `xpra` and
as a starting point for creating an elegant, exhaustive and correct `zsh`
completion script.

Your [feedback|contributions] towards [functionality|code quality] are very much
welcome!

Cheers,
dtk
